Hello everyone and good evening from rahul, greeshma and sriram. Last two months at codepath have been really intense and fun. Our team had a different problem. We kept running out of milk for our late night coffee and things to eat while we tried to finish our assignments.
And let's admit, making a trip to the store for just a few items is so painful. 

That is the problem we have been focussed on for the last 3 weeks and believe we have an elegant solution for this fairly complex problem.

Three ideas drove the direction of our product. 
	1. People need to have trust on who is handling their food
	2. User experience needs to be fun, fast and intuitive. This is a very natural action for the users and we don't want to add any friction to it
	3. Messaging: when are people most likely to help


We have something beautiful come out of this and we would like to share that with you all


We are very proud of what we have built and we would like to leave you with just one thought: a friend in need, is a social shopper indeed
